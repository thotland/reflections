How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

It cleared away all the parts that are the same, allowing the differences to stand out.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

If I changed something that broke the code, I could easily change it back. Or re-implement something that was taken out in an earlier version.


What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

Pros: fewer versions to keep track of, can track important and complete changes
Cons: user error- no commits, may choose to commit at wrong time

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

They are made for programmers that have more complex needs. Some of those needs include multi-file programs.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

Use Git log to see the different versions of the file and get the commit number. Then I can use those commit numbers to compare two versions to see what was changed, how many lines were added and deleted.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

I would feel confident to try out anything, knowing that I could revert the program/repository to the point before I made the changes that broke it.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

I would like to post my fix for the eyeCam.py so that the group can get to it. And so I can work on it.
