When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  When working from multiple computers.
  When working with more than one person on project.
  When the same files need to be installed on multiple work stations.
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-tp-date with your remote repository?
  In case someone introduces changes that I don't want.
  So I can choose where the updates go, ie. remote desktops.
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of the other?
  Forks copy and credit repositories only on GitHub. A fork "Parent" does not change when changing the personal fork.
  Clones copy the repository locally or from GitHub. Clones get updated with push/pull.
  Branches can isolate the master from being changed. They can allow experimentation without affecting the main code.
